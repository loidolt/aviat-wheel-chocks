## First Attempt
Aviat reached out to me to build them some custom wheel chocks to include with their Husky airplanes. This is the first attempt to create those. Our initial idea was to make a silicone mold and roto-cast the chocks using urethane before filling them with expanding foam. Unfortunately, this plane didn't work very well primarily due to the geometry of the part but also due to my lack of roto-casting experience.

## Second Attempt
Second, and more successful, attempt to make wheel chocks for Aviat. After the failure of the first method, we decided to carve them all individually on the CNC. A custom jig was made, all the chocks were carved, and they were finished with a heavy dip in yellow enamel paint.
